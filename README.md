# Hong-Kong-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
A data analysis of the only other city in the world I would settle for

(in progress, will continue when i'm done with the semester)



****Self reminder:
1. Used the Yelp Fusion API for the restaurant, mall, and park data
2. Property data was scraped from https://www.midland.com.hk/en/market-insight
